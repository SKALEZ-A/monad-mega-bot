# Active Context: Monad Telegram Trading Bot

## Current Work Focus
- Ensuring all project documentation is up-to-date and complete in the memory bank
- Reviewing and documenting the architecture, workflows, and technical context
- Preparing the codebase for future enhancements and easier onboarding for new contributors

## Recent Changes
- Created and updated memory bank files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
- Verified that the codebase uses official Monad testnet contract addresses and configuration
- Confirmed that wallet encryption, token scanning, and multi-chain support are implemented as described

## Next Steps
- Review and update progress.md to reflect what works, what needs improvement, and known issues
- Ensure all environment variables are documented and .env.example is provided if missing
- Consider adding more automated tests and error handling for edge cases
- Plan for future features: persistent encrypted storage, multi-chain bridging, analytics, LP management

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Maintain a modular, extensible architecture for easy addition of new chains and features
- Prioritize user security and transparency in all wallet and transaction operations
- Keep documentation and memory bank files as the single source of truth for project context
