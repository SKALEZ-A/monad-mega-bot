# Product Context: Monad Telegram Trading Bot

## Why This Project Exists
- Simplifies token trading on Monad Testnet for non-technical users via Telegram.
- Provides a secure, user-friendly interface for wallet management, token swaps, and transfers.
- Solves the problem of fragmented, complex DeFi interfaces by offering a unified, guided experience.
- Enables users to discover and manage all their tokens, not just a predefined list.

## Problems Solved
- **Wallet Security**: Users can safely create/import wallets with encrypted private key storage.
- **Token Discovery**: Automatically scans and displays all tokens in a wallet, not just popular ones.
- **Transaction Transparency**: Real-time progress, price impact, and explorer links for every transaction.
- **Multi-Wallet Management**: Users can manage multiple wallets under one Telegram account.
- **Customization**: Users can set slippage, manage watchlists, and personalize their experience.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: All actions accessible via clear buttons and commands.
- **Transparency**: Always show network, transaction status, and errors in user-friendly language.
- **Security**: Never expose or store private keys in plain text; require confirmation for sensitive actions.
- **Responsiveness**: Provide immediate feedback for every action, including loading/progress indicators.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new chains, tokens, or features without disrupting the user experience.

## How It Should Work
- Users interact with the bot via Telegram commands and buttons.
- Onboarding guides users to create/import a wallet securely.
- All wallet actions (swap, send, view balances) are available from the main menu.
- Token discovery is automatic; users see all assets in their wallet.
- Swaps and transfers show step-by-step progress and require explicit confirmation.
- Settings and watchlists are persistent and easy to manage.
- All blockchain interactions are abstracted for the user, with clear error handling and recovery paths.
