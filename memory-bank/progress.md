# Progress: Monad Telegram Trading Bot

## What Works
- Telegram bot runs and responds to all documented commands and menu actions
- Wallet creation/import with AES-256-CBC encrypted private key storage
- Multi-wallet support per user
- Token swaps and transfers on Monad Testnet using Uniswap contracts
- Real-time transaction progress, price impact, and explorer links
- Token discovery via BlockVision API and direct blockchain scanning
- User preferences (slippage, watchlist) are persistent and functional
- Modular support for multiple chains (Monad, MegaETH)

## What's Left to Build
- Persistent encrypted storage for wallet data (beyond in-memory/local JSON)
- Multi-chain bridging and cross-chain portfolio view
- Trading history and analytics for users
- LP token management and additional DEX integrations
- More advanced error handling and automated testing
- Batch operations (e.g., batch transfers)
- Enhanced portfolio analytics and historical transaction view

## Current Status
- Core trading, wallet, and token management features are stable on Monad Testnet
- Codebase is modular and ready for extension to new chains and features
- Documentation and memory bank are up-to-date

## Known Issues
- No mainnet support (testnet only)
- No persistent database (uses local JSON for preferences)
- API rate limits may affect token discovery if BlockVision/Alchemy quotas are exceeded
- Some error messages could be further improved for clarity
- No automated test suite currently implemented
